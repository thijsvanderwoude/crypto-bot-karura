I wrote this during my burnout sometime after I got released from my contract.

This is one of my best projects yet. I found the source code just now, and
decided to throw it online because there were some good useful bits I wrote in
there. No framework, no nothing. Just me, skills to hone and time to pass.

The usecase for this bot was that it helped me make decisions on when to sell
crypto for a profit and when to buy. It actually did work really well, I will
not disclose publically how much it made me but it was certainly an amount.
My friends know what car I drove before and what car I drive now.

It was a tool. A damn good one. I'm proud that this ran for months straight
with no errors. Obviously I'm not developing it anymore as I've grown out of
crypto trading. It's also definitely not bulletproof and CERTAINLY not
user-friendly. I learned to do what I told the bot to do and thus it became
obsolete to me.

The bots name was Karura, it had nothing to do with the DeFi exchange I found
while writing this document. The license is 3-BSD.
